- TrashIt brings residents across the globe closer to recycle waste flawlessly and with ease. Through open data taken from collaborative project OpenStreetMap and local government agencies' open data, TrashIt displays up-to-date trash and other waste dropoff points, pick-up schedules for when to take the trash out on the street and food packaging scan capability to help users throw away in the right garbage can.
