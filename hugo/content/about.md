Full-Stack Developer crafting intelligent web experiences where **front-end meets AI**. Currently optimizing Meta AI models for French language applications at Alignerr, fine-tuning large language models to enhance text generation, translation quality, and cultural nuance recognition.  

My passion drives projects like TrashIt geolocation system **built with Django, Docker, and WebSockets**—and KanMind, a scalable API gateway handling local folder structure that slashed task management latency through optimized queries.  

I thrive in open-source ecosystems, containerizing full-stack solutions with Docker while leveraging **REST APIs, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript frameworks** to build efficient, collaborative tools.
